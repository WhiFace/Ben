Positioning:
            Static: All elements are originally set to this position
            Relative: Relative to the position of the elements
            Absolute: relative to the Absolute position of the element
            Fixed: Fixed to the position. Good for Navs and Sidebars

            Marging Positioning:
            text-align:
Fonts:

              merriweather
              sacremanto
              monserrat

              use rem for font size

              .Right-img-dsc{
                clear: left;
              }

              .Left-img-dec{
                clear:right;
              }
Wrapping text around objects: Only use float to do this. Don't use float to do Positioning, but use the position properties.
